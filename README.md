# Vehicle Value Predictor

This repository contains a web application that predicts the value of vehicles using the RandomForestRegressor algorithm. The application is built using the Flask web framework, providing a user-friendly interface to input vehicle details and receive an estimated value based on the trained regression machine learning model, which is well-suited for solving regression problems. You can access the live version of this web application [here](https://vehiclealuepredictor.azurewebsites.net/).
